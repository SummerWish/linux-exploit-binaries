linux-exploit-binaries
======================

## WTF is this?

Just a repo of some linux exploit binaries. I don't want to compile these exploits again and again especially on those machines without gcc & root, so I compiled and put them here.

Don't ask me how to run / the platform / why broken / ...

I'm not the author of these exploits and won't give any support for this repo.
